`slk` is a single static Go binary for the Slack Web API, designed for AI agents and the
humans they collaborate with. Compared to the official Slack MCP connector — which returns
verbose, fixed-shape JSON envelopes — `slk` emits curated, low-token output by default and
exposes `--raw` when a caller wants full API responses.

## Why slk?

`slk` is built for agent workflows that talk to Slack frequently. Compared to the official
Slack MCP connector, it is meaningfully cheaper per round-trip:

| Operation | MCP response | `slk` default response |
|---|---|---|
| Send message | 200–400 tokens (full message object) | ~7 tokens (`sent <ts>`) |
| Read 3 messages | 1000–2000 tokens (full metadata each) | ~150 tokens (concise JSON) |
| Search users | 500+ tokens per user (profile + avatars + tz) | ~20 tokens per user (`name id extra`) |
| Delete a message | Full envelope echo | ~2 tokens (`delete ok`) |

Why the gap:

1. **No persistent tool schema.** `slk` is invoked via `Bash`; the agent does not carry the
   13 MCP tool schemas (~5–10 K tokens) in its context.
2. **Curated by default.** Every read command renders a concise summary; `--format json` and
   `--raw` are opt-in for full structure.
3. **Default ID resolution.** `slk` maps `U…` / `C…` to human-readable names so the model
   does not need a second round-trip to interpret IDs.
4. **Shell composability.** Pipe through `jq`, `head`, `grep` to filter bytes before they
   reach the model.
5. **Opt-in detail.** `--raw` and `--format json` return the full envelope only when asked;
   MCP returns it every call.

When MCP is still the better choice:

- The agent cannot execute a shell at all.
- You need strict JSON-schema contracts for tool-calling integration.

In typical agent workflows the savings compound: roughly **5–20× cheaper per call** and
**2–5× cheaper across a full session**, depending on how much of the traffic is short
confirmations and ID-resolved reads — the regime `slk` is designed to shine in.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+ (only required if you install from source).
- A Slack workspace where you can create your own Slack app. `slk` uses your own OAuth
  credentials; it never embeds a client secret in the binary.
- A Slack user OAuth token (`xoxp-…`) or bot token (`xoxb-…`) with the scopes for the commands
  you plan to use. See [Authentication](#authentication).

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install howar31/tap/slk
```

Adds the `howar31/homebrew-tap` formula automatically on first install.

### npm (anywhere Node.js 18+ runs)

```bash
npm install -g @howar31/slk
```

The package is scoped (`@howar31/slk`) because the unscoped name `slk` is already taken on
npm. `postinstall` downloads the matching prebuilt binary from GitHub Releases and verifies
its SHA256 checksum.

### Pre-built binary

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/howar31/slk/releases).
Replace `<os>` with `darwin` or `linux`, and `<arch>` with `amd64` or `arm64`.
The `latest/download/` path always resolves to the newest release — no version to update.

```bash
curl -sLO https://github.com/howar31/slk/releases/latest/download/slk_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz
curl -sLO https://github.com/howar31/slk/releases/latest/download/checksums.txt
shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing
tar xzf slk_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz
sudo mv slk /usr/local/bin/
slk --version
```

### `go install` (Go 1.25+)

```bash
go install github.com/howar31/slk/cmd/slk@latest
```

Places `slk` in `$GOBIN` (typically `$HOME/go/bin`); ensure `$GOBIN` is on your `$PATH`.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/howar31/slk
cd slk
go build -o slk ./cmd/slk   # version is read from the committed VERSION file
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Confirm the install
slk --version

# Store your token (see Authentication for how to obtain one)
slk auth set-token --profile work --token xoxp-...

# Read the last 5 messages of a channel
slk msg read --channel C0123456789 --limit 5

# Send a message
slk msg send --channel C0123456789 --text "hello"

# Read a canvas as Markdown
slk canvas read --id F0123456789
```

The token in the second Quick start command comes from the
[Authentication](#authentication) steps below.

## Authentication

`slk` authenticates with **your own** Slack app — it does not embed a client secret. Create the
app once (steps 1–2), then get a token into `slk` by **either** pasting one **or** running the
OAuth flow (step 3); both are first-class and either works for a single user.

### 1. Create your Slack app

Visit <https://api.slack.com/apps> → **Create New App**. Two paths:

- **From an app manifest** (recommended) — pick your workspace, paste the JSON manifest below
  into the editor (it opens in JSON; YAML also works), and create the app. It pre-fills every
  scope `slk` uses, so you can skip step 2 and go straight to installing.
- **From scratch** — pick a name and workspace, then add scopes by hand in step 2.

The manifest's `user:` list is every scope `slk`'s curated commands can use as a user token,
and the `bot:` list covers the same commands that also work with a bot token. Not every command
needs every scope; trim the list to the subset you actually run.

### 2. Optional — Add or edit OAuth scopes (skip if you created from the manifest)

Under **OAuth & Permissions** → **User Token Scopes** (for `xoxp-`) or **Bot Token Scopes**
(for `xoxb-`), add scopes one at a time, choosing the ones you need from the `user:` or `bot:`
list above.

To change scopes on an app you already created, open **Features → App Manifest** in the app's
settings, edit the `user:` or `bot:` list there, and **Save Changes** — Slack applies the diff
and prompts you to reinstall if you added new scopes.

### 3. Get a token into `slk`

Two ways — pick one. Each stores a single token (`xoxp-` or `xoxb-`) into a profile; the OAuth
flow is also how a team shares one app (see [Team setup](#team-setup)).

- **Method A — paste a token** (simplest): install the app, copy its token, paste it in. No
  client secret, no redirect URL.
- **Method B — OAuth flow (`slk auth login`)**: `slk` mints the token through your browser, so
  you never copy a raw token by hand.

#### Method A — paste a token

On the **OAuth & Permissions** page (the same one as step 2), scroll to the top and click
**Install to Workspace**. Approve the prompt; the **User OAuth Token** (`xoxp-…`) then appears
at the top of that page — copy it. Some workspaces require an admin to approve the install.

Then store it. Run it in a terminal with no arguments — `slk` asks for each field and hides the
token as you paste it, so nothing lands in your shell history:

```bash
slk auth set-token
```

It prompts for two things:

- **`Profile name [default]:`** — a label for this set of credentials, so you can keep more
  than one (e.g. `work`, `personal`) and switch between them with `slk auth switch <name>`.
  Press Enter to accept `default`.
- **`Paste token (xoxp- or xoxb-, hidden):`** — the token you just copied. A profile holds
  exactly one token; its scope (user/bot) is derived from the `xoxp-`/`xoxb-` prefix.
  Input is hidden; paste it and press Enter.

Scripting it instead? Pass values as flags (`slk auth set-token --help`), and use `--token -`
to read the token from stdin so it stays out of history:
`printf '%s' "$TOKEN" | slk auth set-token --profile work --token -`.

#### Method B — OAuth flow (`slk auth login`)

1. **OAuth & Permissions → Redirect URLs**: add `http://localhost:3000/callback` (the port
   `slk auth login` listens on; override with `--port`), and **Install to Workspace** if you
   have not already.
2. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from **Basic Information → App Credentials**.
3. Run the flow:

```bash
slk auth login --client-id <id> --client-secret <secret>
```

`slk` prints an authorize URL and starts a local listener; open the URL, approve, and `slk`
exchanges the code for a token and stores it. By default it mints a user token (`xoxp-`); pass
`--as bot` to mint a bot token (`xoxb-`) instead. The client secret is used only for that
exchange and is **never** persisted. Run with no arguments in a terminal to be prompted for
each field instead (the client secret is entered hidden).

Either way, the token lands in `~/.config/slk/config.toml` (mode `0600`) and is encrypted at
rest (see [Credential storage](#credential-storage)). `slk` never prints token contents.

### 4. Verify it worked

```bash
slk auth status   # lists profiles + verifies the active one live against Slack
slk auth test     # explicit live check of the active token
```

`slk auth status` lists each profile as `<marker> <name> [<scope>]` (e.g. `* work [bot]`)
where scope is `user`, `bot`, `none`, `encrypted`, or `unknown` — derived from the token prefix,
not stored. It also shows the encryption backend, and verifies the **active** profile live
against Slack — appending its identity (`<team> (<team_id>) — <user> (<user_id>) @ <url>`) on
success, `(invalid token: …)` if Slack rejects it, or `(offline: …)` if Slack is unreachable.
Pass `--all` to verify every profile, `--offline` to skip the network and list local info only,
or `--format json` for a structured object (includes `encryption`, `active`, and `profiles[]`
fields). It never prints the token itself.

`slk auth test` is the explicit single-token check: it calls Slack's `auth.test` and prints the
same identity line. A bad token returns an auth error (`invalid_auth` / `not_authed`) and exits
`3` — re-check the token and redo step 3.

### Credential storage

The single `token` field per profile is encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. Tokens you add
with `slk auth set-token` or `slk auth login` are encrypted on write; an existing plaintext
value (for example one you hand-edited into the file) keeps working and is encrypted the next
time `slk` writes the config — no re-authentication is ever required. `slk` does
**not** persist the OAuth `client_id` / `client_secret`: `auth login` uses them only
transiently for the token exchange, never writing them to the config.

The 32-byte encryption key is held in one of two backends, selected by the
`SLK_KEYRING_BACKEND` environment variable:

- `auto` (default) — use the OS keyring if one is available, otherwise fall back to a key
  file. This keeps `slk` usable in headless / CI / agent environments with no interactive
  keyring.
- `keyring` — always use the OS keyring (macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service, Windows
  Credential Manager). Strongest protection; may prompt to unlock.
- `file` — store the key in `~/.config/slk/.encryption_key` (mode `0600`).

The backend actually used is recorded in the config so reads stay deterministic. `slk auth
status` shows the backend and whether decryption is healthy, never any secret.

**What this protects against:** accidental disclosure — a token no longer sits in the config
file as readable text, so it will not leak through a casual `cat`, screen-sharing, dotfile
sync, or backups. The `file` backend keeps the key next to the config, so it is **not** a
defense against someone who can already read your `~/.config/slk/` directory; for real
local-attacker protection use the `keyring` backend.

### Precedence

Active credential resolution, highest precedence first:

1. `SLK_TOKEN` environment variable.
2. `--profile <name>` command-line flag.
3. `SLK_PROFILE` environment variable.
4. The `active` profile in the config file.

## Agent setup

`slk`'s agent skills (the `skills/` tree) are **generated from the CLI itself** —
every command, flag, the Slack method each one wraps, and a confirm-before-writing
caution on destructive verbs. The skill is split per command group: a small `slk`
index lists the groups and links to one `slk-<group>` skill each, alongside a shared
`slk-shared` reference — so an agent loads only the surface it needs instead of one
large file. Because they are generated and drift-guarded in CI, your agent always
sees accurate, in-sync docs instead of hand-written files that lag the code. Install
them with `npx skills`, or wire them in manually below.

### Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Cursor, and other skill-aware agents

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/howar31/slk   # then follow the wizard
npx skills update                               # update later
```

Follow the [`npx skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) wizard to choose your agents
and skills — pick all the `slk` skills, since the index links to one skill per command group.

Manual fallback (no `npx`, or an agent it doesn't support) — copy the tree into the
agent's skills directory yourself:

```bash
cp -R ./skills/slk ./skills/slk-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Others

For agents without a skills directory, either reference `slk --help` from the agent's
instruction file, or paste the contents of the index skill
[`skills/slk/SKILL.md`](skills/slk/SKILL.md) (which links to the per-group skills) into the
agent's persistent rules file (e.g., `.cursorrules`, `GEMINI.md`).

## Usage

The complete, always-current command reference is the CLI's own help. It shares a
single source with the binary — the same command tree the agent skill is generated
from — so it can't drift out of sync:

```bash
slk --help                 # all command groups
slk <group> --help         # a group's verbs   (e.g. slk msg --help)
slk <group> <verb> --help  # a verb's flags     (e.g. slk msg send --help)
```

Global flags such as `--format`, `--raw`, `--dry-run`, and `--as` apply to every command;
`slk --help` lists them all. `--as user|bot` has two behaviors: on any regular command it
asserts the active token's scope and exits `3` on a known mismatch; on `auth login` it selects
which token type to mint (default `user`; see [Bot mode](#bot-mode)). Agents get the same
surface as a generated skill ([`skills/slk/SKILL.md`](skills/slk/SKILL.md)) — see
[Agent setup](#agent-setup).

The rest of this section documents only what `--help` can't convey on its own —
usage traps, conceptual data shapes, and behavior notes:

### Checking for updates

```bash
slk version          # print the running version (fully offline)
slk version --check  # ask GitHub Releases whether a newer version exists
```

`slk version --check` makes a single read-only request to the GitHub Releases
API and reports whether a newer version is available, plus the command to
upgrade. It **never downloads or replaces the binary** — upgrading stays your
package manager's job (`brew upgrade slk`, `npm i -g @howar31/slk@latest`, or a
fresh download from the [Releases](https://github.com/howar31/slk/releases)
page).

The check is best-effort: if GitHub is unreachable or rate-limited, slk prints
your current version with a note and still exits `0`. Pass `--format json` for
machine-readable output — agents can read the `update_available` and `checked`
fields. A locally built binary reports the version from the committed `VERSION`
file — the same value a released build embeds.

Plain `slk version` and `slk --version` perform no network I/O.

### Multi-line content

Bash double-quoted `"\n"` is a literal backslash-n, not a newline. To pass real multi-line
content, use the file or stdin alternative:

```bash
slk canvas create --title "Weekly" --markdown-file weekly.md
cat weekly.md | slk canvas update --id F0123456789 --action prepend --markdown-file -
```

`--markdown-file` is available on `canvas create` / `canvas update`. `--text-file` is
available on `msg send` / `msg draft` / `msg schedule` / `msg update` / `thread reply` /
`file upload`. Use
`-` as the path to read from stdin.

### Images and attachments

These features are maintained in this fork. Build this fork from source; upstream
packages and releases do not necessarily include them.

Message and thread reads retain file and image references, including image-only
messages, Block Kit images, and legacy attachment images. Message search retains
references when Slack includes them in its response. Reads do not download files or
perform extra file lookups. JSON/JSONL output includes `files` and `images` only when
present, with URLs, MIME types, dimensions, and alt text where available.

The agent viewing workflow is **URL-first**:

- View an accessible image URL directly with the agent's image-capable tool.
- A reference marked `requires_auth: true` needs Slack authentication. Use
  `file download` with the file ID (or its supported Slack-hosted image URL), then
  give the returned local path to the image viewer. Do not put a Slack token in a
  URL or pass it to the agent.
- `external: true` denotes a provider-hosted file. `requires_auth: false` means no
  Slack credentials should be attached; it does not guarantee the external
  provider allows anonymous access. Provider authentication is outside this command.

For example, after a read identifies a protected image:

```bash
slk file download --file F01234567
# Prints an absolute local path suitable for the agent's image viewer.
```

Without `--output`, downloads use a new private temporary directory (0700) and a
file readable only by the owner (0600). The default size limit is 25 MiB; adjust
`--max-bytes` explicitly if needed. Existing output files are never overwritten.
Successful files stay available until the caller removes them **after viewing**;
failed downloads remove their partial files. JSON/JSONL output supplies the path
and metadata; binary bytes and base64 are never printed. `--raw` is not supported
for downloads. Files are not made public.

Sending with `msg send --file` or `thread reply --file` uploads a local file into
Slack. Repeat the flag for multiple files in one message; image-only messages are
allowed. Text becomes the uploaded files' caption, rather than a separate chat
message. The same caption and thread options are available on `file upload`.
`--alt-text` supplies an image description to each uploaded file. With multiple
files, titles default to their filenames; `file upload --title` is single-file only.
File replies cannot use `--reply-broadcast`.

Slack-hosted uploads use the supported external-upload workflow, not the retired
`files.upload` method. Uploads require `files:write`; sending to a bare user ID also
needs `im:write` to open the DM. Downloads require `files:read` and access to the
file. Slack Connect placeholders may need a later file lookup; a missing URL or
inaccessible file is reported explicitly.

### Drafts

`msg draft` creates a draft via Slack's `drafts.create` endpoint. The companion lifecycle
endpoints (`drafts.list` / `drafts.delete` / `drafts.update`) require Slack-client token types
that are not available to OAuth user tokens; use the Slack desktop or web client's
**Drafts & Sent** panel to list, edit, or delete drafts. The URL emitted by `msg draft` opens
the channel where the draft lives.

### Slack Lists item shape

Slack's Lists API uses rich-text blocks even for plain-text columns:

```bash
# Find the column ID once
slk api slackLists.create --params '{"name":"my list"}'
# → { "list_id": "F0…", "list_metadata": { "schema": [ { "id": "Col0…", … } ] } }

# Add an item
slk list add-item --id F0… --fields '[
  {
    "column_id": "Col0…",
    "rich_text": [{
      "type": "rich_text",
      "elements": [{
        "type": "rich_text_section",
        "elements": [{"type": "text", "text": "hello"}]
      }]
    }]
  }
]'

# Update a cell — slk auto-fills row_id into any cell that omits it.
slk list update-item --id F0… --row-id Rec0… --fields '[
  {
    "column_id": "Col0…",
    "rich_text": [{
      "type": "rich_text",
      "elements": [{
        "type": "rich_text_section",
        "elements": [{"type": "text", "text": "updated"}]
      }]
    }]
  }
]'
```

To update cells across multiple rows in one call, put `row_id` inside each cell; `--row-id`
becomes the fallback for cells that omit it.

### Escape hatch — `slk api`

`slk api <method>` invokes any Slack Web API method. Nested objects in `--params` must be
pre-serialized JSON strings (Slack's Web API uses form-urlencoded transport):

```bash
# WRONG — criteria is a nested object literal
slk api canvases.sections.lookup \
  --params '{"canvas_id":"F0…","criteria":{"section_types":["any_header"]}}'

# RIGHT — criteria is a JSON-encoded string
slk api canvases.sections.lookup \
  --params '{"canvas_id":"F0…","criteria":"{\"section_types\":[\"any_header\"]}"}'
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SLK_TOKEN` | Token override. Highest precedence — bypasses the config file entirely. |
| `SLK_PROFILE` | Active profile name. Used when `--profile` is not passed. |
| `SLK_CONFIG` | Config file path override. Default: `~/.config/slk/config.toml`. |
| `SLK_KEYRING_BACKEND` | At-rest encryption-key backend: `auto` (default), `keyring`, or `file`. See [Credential storage](#credential-storage). |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Other error (network, JSON parse, miscellaneous). |
| `2` | Reserved (Cobra usage errors currently still map to `1`; v1.2). |
| `3` | Auth error (`invalid_auth`, `token_expired`, `not_authed`, missing profile). |
| `4` | Not found (`channel_not_found`, `user_not_found`, `message_not_found`, …). |
| `5` | Rate limited after the retry budget was exhausted. |

## Bot mode

A bot token (`xoxb-`) is the **automation subset** of user mode, not a parallel replacement.
The write-heavy core — posting, scheduling, reactions, channel management, canvas, Slack Lists,
file upload, pins, bookmarks — works fully. Three areas degrade or vanish:

- ❌ **Not available under a bot:** `search messages` / `search files` / `search all` and
  `canvas list` (all rely on the Search API, which is user-token-only); `user set-profile` /
  `set-photo` / `delete-photo` (personal profile writes); `dnd snooze` / `end-snooze` / `end`
  (DND state is per-user); `file public` / `revoke-public`; `msg draft`. (`user set-presence`
  runs but has no effect for a bot.)
- ⚠️ **Reduced effect:** `msg read` and `thread read` only see channels the bot has joined
  (DM history is limited to the bot's own DMs); `msg update`, `msg delete`, and `file delete`
  only operate on the bot's own messages or files.
- ✅ **Everything else** works the same as user mode. The `bot:` scope list in the app manifest
  above is the live reference for what the bot token covers; per-verb flags are in `--help`.

**Getting a bot token — two paths:**

```bash
# OAuth flow — slk mints the xoxb- through your browser:
slk auth login --as bot --client-id <id> --client-secret <secret>

# Paste flow — copy the Bot User OAuth Token (xoxb-...) from the app's
# OAuth & Permissions page, then store it:
slk auth set-token --token xoxb-...
```

A profile holds exactly one token. If you want both a user identity and a bot identity, use
**two profiles** — for example `--profile work` for your `xoxp-` token and `--profile work-bot`
for the `xoxb-`. Switch between them with `--profile <name>` or the `SLK_PROFILE` environment
variable. `slk auth status` will show `[bot]` next to the profile once it is in place.

To assert that a command runs under a bot token (and fail fast with exit `3` if a user token
is active instead), pass `--as bot`; conversely `--as user` asserts a user token. With no
`--as`, `slk` uses whatever token is in the active profile without checking its scope.

## Known Slack-side limitations

These behaviors come from Slack itself, not from `slk`:

- **Scheduled messages within ~5 minutes of `post_at` may still fire after
  `chat.deleteScheduledMessage` returns `ok=true`.** Slack appears to lock the message into
  its delivery queue before firing; the cancel succeeds in the API but the message still
  posts. Empirically T+180 s is unreliable, T+600 s is reliable. For cancellable schedules,
  pick `--at` at least 5–10 minutes in the future.
- **`msg delete` on a self-DM returns `chat.delete: internal_error`.** Slack restricts API
  deletion of 1:1 DMs; use the Slack desktop or web UI.
- **Slack Lists have no whole-list delete API.** `slackLists.delete` returns `unknown_method`,
  so an entire List must be removed in the Slack UI. Individual rows can be removed with
  `list delete-item` (`slackLists.items.delete`).
- **`channel invite` cannot invite a channel's creator or any existing member.** Slack
  returns `cant_invite_self` / `already_in_channel`. `slk` surfaces the error verbatim.
- **`canvas read` cannot recover the original code-block language hint.** Slack's HTML
  download route drops the triple-backtick language identifier. Text content is preserved;
  the language tag is not.
- **`drafts.list` / `drafts.delete` / `drafts.update` require a Slack-client token type
  that is not available to OAuth user tokens.** Manage drafts in the Slack UI.

## Team setup

An advanced rollout for sharing one Slack app across a team. One app serves everyone — you do
**not** create an app per person. One person sets it up once; each teammate then authorizes it
and gets their **own** user token (`xoxp-`). Tokens are per-user (each carries that person's
identity and permissions), so never share a single token.

### One-time, by the app owner

1. Create the app and add scopes — [Authentication](#authentication) steps 1–2. The manifest's
   `user:` list is the set everyone gets: the OAuth consent screen is **all-or-nothing**
   (**Allow** / **Cancel**, with the scope checkboxes greyed out), so a teammate can't pick
   scopes in the browser. To grant fewer, a teammate narrows `--scopes` on the `slk auth login`
   command *before* authorizing (it can never exceed the app's set); to make scopes toggleable
   in the browser, mark them **optional** in the app settings / manifest.
2. **OAuth & Permissions → Redirect URLs**: add `http://localhost:3000/callback` (the port
   `slk auth login` listens on; override with `--port`).
3. **Manage Distribution → Activate Public Distribution**, so teammates who are *not* app
   collaborators can authorize it.
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from **Basic Information → App Credentials**.

### Per teammate

Each teammate runs the OAuth flow with the shared app credentials to mint their own token:

```bash
slk auth login --client-id <id> --client-secret <secret>
```

This is exactly [Authentication](#authentication) **Method B** — it prints an authorize URL and
starts a local listener on `localhost:3000` (the `--port`). Open the printed URL in a browser and
approve; Slack redirects back to that listener with a code, which `slk` exchanges and stores as
the teammate's own `xoxp-` token (encrypted at rest). The listener waits ~5 minutes, then times
out. Verify with `slk auth status` / `slk auth test` — see [Authentication](#authentication)
step 4.

## Development

```bash
# Build (version is read from the committed VERSION file)
go build -o slk ./cmd/slk

# Run the full test suite (uncached)
go clean -testcache && go test ./...

# Coverage snapshot
go test ./... -coverpkg=./... -coverprofile=/tmp/slk.cov >/dev/null
go tool cover -func=/tmp/slk.cov | tail -1

# A single test
go test ./internal/commands/ -run TestInjectRowID -v

# Regenerate the agent skills after changing any command (CI enforces no drift)
go run ./cmd/slk generate-skills
```
